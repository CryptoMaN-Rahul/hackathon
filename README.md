- Assess contract risk and potential vulnerabilities

## Example Queries

### Smart Contract Security Analysis
Ask the agent to analyze any smart contract by providing its address:
```
Analyze the security of smart contract 0x7a250d5630B4cF539739dF2C5dAcb4c659F2488D. Identify critical vulnerabilities and provide a risk assessment.
```

### Wallet Transaction Analysis
Request detailed analysis of wallet activity:
```
Examine transaction history for wallet 0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045 over the past month. Identify significant transactions, recurring patterns, and calculate total value transferred.
```

### Token Concentration Analysis
Understand token distribution and whale concentration:
```
Analyze holder distribution for the EDGE token on Ethereum. Determine concentration risk level and how many wallets control the majority of tokens.
```

### DeFi Position Assessment
Calculate impermanent loss and get strategy recommendations:
```
Calculate impermanent loss for an ETH/USDT liquidity position if ETH price changes by +25%. Provide a recommended strategy for minimizing this risk.
```

### Yield Optimization Recommendation
Find the best yield opportunities based on your risk profile:
```
Based on a moderate risk profile, identify the best yield opportunities currently available across major DeFi protocols. Include expected APY and relevant risk factors.
```

### Historical Performance Comparison
Compare blockchain metrics over time:
```
Compare transaction volume and price correlation between ETH and BNB over the last quarter. Determine which blockchain showed more consistent growth patterns.
```

### Cross-Chain Analysis
Analyze bridge transactions and security:
```
Analyze recent bridge transactions between Ethereum and Arbitrum. Identify unusual patterns and potential security concerns in cross-chain transfers.
```

### Wallet Security Assessment
Check wallet security and interaction history:
```
Perform a security analysis on wallet 0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc454e4438f44e. Has it interacted with flagged contracts or shown suspicious transaction patterns?
```

### Liquidity Pool Analysis
Get insights on specific liquidity pools:
```
Analyze liquidity pool 0x8ad599c3a0ff1de082011efddc58f1908eb6e6d8 on Ethereum. Provide depth, volume, and impermanent loss risk assessment.
```
